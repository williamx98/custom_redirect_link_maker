# Custom Redirect Link Maker
This script is designed to generate an index.html that will automatically redirect links from your homepage to other links.  
  
For me, this was just a practical application of basic Bash programming applying fundamental concepts like conditional branching, working with variables, string manipulation and outputting to a file.

## Example
[```https://willx.org/linkedin```](https://willx.org/linkedin) will redirect to [```https://linkedin.com/in/williamx98```](https://linkedin.com/in/williamx98)

## Usage
```./custom_redirect_link [LINK]```  
The script will automatically append ```https://``` if you have not included it as apart of your link.
